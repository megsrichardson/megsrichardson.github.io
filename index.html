<h1>Hello World, it's Megan!</h1>
<p>I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech with two majors and a minor I'm aiming to get but have not yet declared. My goal as I reach the next two years of my college experience is to join more clubs and be overall more active in things other than class. Sure, academics comes first being a student, but it should be fun, too, right? So hopefully, next year, I will have much more involvement so that when I describe my academic experience at Tech, I can say more than just my majors.</p>
